**Note:** &emsp; Please check [GPU Script - Vulkan Version Compatibility](Vulkan_Compatibility.md) before downloading Vulkan.

-----

## **(1) Set up Ubuntu dev environment**

### Install Visual Studio Code and set up extensions.

[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

These extensions are useful for building the project:

### Open a terminal and install the GCC compiler and CMake.

```
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install cmake
```
-----

## **(2) Install the Vulkan driver for your graphics card**

### Check what kind of graphics card you have by going to `Settings > Details > About`.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/ubuntu_about.png" width="600">

Get the latest drivers by enabling a PPA. 

If you already have these PPA's installed, you can skip the `sudo add-apt-repository` step. You can also check and manage what PPA's and external software you have installed by opening Ubuntu's **Software & Updates** and looking on the **Other Software** tab.

For **AMD / Intel**:

The [kisak-mesa PPA](https://launchpad.net/~kisak/+archive/ubuntu/kisak-mesa) or [oiabaf graphics drivers PPA](https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers) are good options.

To install drivers using kisak-mesa PPA:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kisak/kisak-mesa
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers
```

Alternatively, you can use the oiabaf PPA:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers
```

For **NVIDIA**:

Enable the [Proprietary GPU Drivers PPA](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) to get the latest NVIDIA drivers.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Check the latest driver version available to you:
```
ubuntu-drivers devices
```

Install the desired driver:
```
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-440
```

**Reboot after you install your drivers.**

## **(3) Install Vulkan**

*Please check [GPU Script - Vulkan Version Compatibility](Vulkan_Compatibility.md) before installing Vulkan.*

**If you plan to install Vulkan 1.2, check with your GPU hardware vendor to see whether they have a driver that supports it.**

>The LunarG SDK for Vulkan 1.2 currently does not include a Vulkan driver. You will need to check with your GPU hardware vendor for a Vulkan Installable Client Driver (ICD). The SDK will allow you to build Vulkan applications but you will need a Vulkan ICD to execute them. 
>* [NVIDIA Drivers](https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver) (Version 440.48.02 supports Vulkan 1.2)
>* [AMD Drivers](https://gpuopen.com/vulkan-1-2-driver-available-latest-radeon-software-adrenalin-2020-edition-20-1-2/)
>* [Intel Drivers](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers) (Version 26.20.100.7755 supports Vulkan 1.2)

### **Option 1:** &emsp; Easy Install With the LunarG VulkanSDK Ubuntu Package <br> *This installs Vulkan to your system paths. <br> Use this option if you do not have Vulkan already installed on your machine.*

### Get instructions for installing the LunarG VulkanSDK with an Ubuntu Package from here:

[https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)

<img src="images/Install_Notes/ubuntu_vulkanpackage.png" width="600">

This will install Vulkan to your system.

You can test whether Vulkan is working by running `vkcube` in the terminal. You should see a spinning LunarG cube.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/ubuntu_vkcube.png" width="500">

### **Option 2:** &emsp; Install Vulkan to a Local Folder  <br> *Use this option if you plan on having multiple verions of Vulkan on your machine.*

### Download the tarfile for the LunarG VulkanSDK from here:

[https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)

<img src="images/Install_Notes/ubuntu_vulkansdk.png" width="600">

Unzip the file to a location of your choice.

### Set up the the runtime environment.

This ensures that when you run a Vulkan application, you are using the correct version. 

Manually set the environment variables:

```cpp
export VULKAN_SDK=~/<PATH TO SDK>/1.1.xx.y/x86_64
export PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export VK_LAYER_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/etc/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
```

Or run the setup script that is provided in the top-level directory of your SDK installation. Use the source command to load that script into your current shell:

```
source ~/<PATH TO SDK>/1.1.xx.y/setup-env.sh
```

You can test whether Vulkan is working by running `<PATH TO SDK>/bin/vkcube`. You should see a spinning LunarG cube.

### If you have multiple versions of Vulkan installed and want to specify which version to use for the project, update [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt) to specify the path to the VulkanSDK you want to use.

This ensures that the program is compiled with the correct Vulkan header version you want to use.

## **(4) Install dependencies**

### Install boost.
```
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
```

### Install dependencies for GLFW.
```
cd ~
sudo apt install libxinerama-dev
sudo apt install libxcursor-dev
sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev
```

### Install dependencies for NativeFileDialog.
```
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
```

-----

## **(5) Open the project in Visual Studio Code**

### The first time you run Visual Studio Code on a C++ project, you may need to do some setup.

If you have installed the CMake Tools extension, you should see a blue bar at the bottom:

![vscode blue bar](images/Install_Notes/vscode_selectkit.png)

Click on `No Kit Selected`, and it should pop up a menu on the screen that lets you choose a compiler. Since we've installed GCC, we will use `GCC 7.4.0`.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/ubuntu_kits.png" width="600">

If there are no kits found, run CMake Tool's `Scan for Kits` command. To open the command palette in VS Code, press   `âŒ˜ + SHIFT + P`.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/cmake_scanforkits.png" width="600">

Once the kit has been found, the bottom blue bar should indicate it has found it.

## **(6) Compile the project**

### Press `Build` to compile the project. 

You may see some warning during the compile process. As long as the executable builds, you can ignore the warnings.

### Open the ExampleApp executable and you should see:

## **(7) Start experimenting with the API**

### Click here to [Get Started!](Get_Started.md)
