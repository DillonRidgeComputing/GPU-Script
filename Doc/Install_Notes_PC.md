**Note:** &emsp; Please check [GPU Script - Vulkan Version Compatibility](Vulkan_Compatibility.md) before downloading Vulkan.


-----

## **(1) Set up Windows dev environment**

### Install Visual Studio Code and set up extensions.

[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

These extensions are useful for building the project:

### Install the MSVC build tools.

Go to the [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) page and download the installer for Visual Studio Community 2019:

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_visualstudio.png">

Run the installer executable. You don't have to install the full Visual Studio Code development environment. Just install the **Desktop development with C++** tools. Make sure you install the MSVC Version 14.2 build tools and CMake.

## **(2) Install Vulkan**

*Please check [GPU Script - Vulkan Version Compatibility](Vulkan_Compatibility.md) before installing Vulkan.*

**If you plan to install Vulkan 1.2, check with your GPU hardware vender to see whether they have a driver that supports it.**

>The LunarG SDK for Vulkan 1.2 currently does not include a Vulkan driver. You will need to check with your GPU hardware vendor for a Vulkan Installable Client Driver (ICD). The SDK will allow you to build Vulkan applications but you will need a Vulkan ICD to execute them. 
>* [NVIDIA Drivers](https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver) (Version 440.99 supports Vulkan 1.2)
>* [AMD Drivers](https://gpuopen.com/vulkan-1-2-driver-available-latest-radeon-software-adrenalin-2020-edition-20-1-2/)
>* [Intel Drivers](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers) (Version 26.20.100.7755 supports Vulkan 1.2)

### Download the installer for the LunarG VulkanSDK from here:

[https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_vulkansdk.png" width="600">

Run the installer. 

The installer will automatically add the VulkanSDK to your Windows PATH. The most recently installed SDK version will be referenced first in the PATH environment variable. In addition, the installer will add the VULKAN_SDK and VULKAN_SDK_PATH environment variables.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_vksdkpath.png" width="600">

You can test whether Vulkan is working by running `Vulkan Cube`. Open `Vulkan Cube` by navigating to the Vulkan SDK folder in the Start Menu. 

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_startvkcube.png" width="250">

If Vulkan is working on your machine, then you should see a spinning LunarG cube.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_vkcube.png" width="500">

### If you have multiple versions of Vulkan installed and want to specify which version to use for the project, update [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt) to specify the path to the VulkanSDK you want to use.

## **(3) Install dependencies**

### Install boost

Boost needs to be built with the same compiler that you are using to build ExampleApp. Download the pre-built boost binaries for MSVC compilers here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.70.0/

Look for the binary that matches MSVC Version 14.2.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_boost.png">

Verify that the `BOOST_ROOT` path in [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt) is the same as where you installed boost. If you installed boost in a custom location, update the path to the location where you installed boost.

## **(4) Open the project in Visual Studio Code**

### The first time you run Visual Studio Code on a C++ project, you may need to do some setup.

If you have installed the CMake Tools extension, you should see a blue bar at the bottom:

![vscode blue bar](images/Install_Notes/vscode_selectkit.png)

Click on `No Kit Selected`, and it should pop up a menu on the screen that lets you choose a compiler. Since we've installed the MSVC 14.2 build tools, we will use `Visual Studio Community 2019 Release - amd64` compiler.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_kits.png" width="600">

If there are no kits found, run CMake Tool's `Scan for Kits` command. To open the command palette in VS Code, press   `âŒ˜ + SHIFT + P`.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/cmake_scanforkits.png" width="600">

Once the kit has been found, the bottom blue bar should indicate it has found it.

![pc kit found](images/Install_Notes/pc_kitfound.png)

### You will also need to specify the path to CMake to the CMake Tools settings file in Visual Studio Code.

To get the path for CMake, open the **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio**. This can be found in the Start Menu folder for Visual Studio:

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_vsdevprompt.png" width="250">

In the prompt, run the command, `where cmake`, and it should print out the path. Copy the path.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_wherecmake.png">

Then, in Visual Studio Code open the CMake Tools settings file. You can do this by navigating to the **Extensions** pane in the side bar and clicking the gear icon under CMake Tools. It will pop up a context menu. Select **Configure Extension Settings**.

<img src="images/Install_Notes/pc_cmakeconfig.png" width="600">

This opens up a UI to set settings for CMake Tools. Scroll down until you see **Cmake: Cmake Path**. Paste the path you copied into the text input box, then close the file.

## **(5) Compile the project**

### Press `Build` to compile the project. 

You may see some warning during the compile process. As long as the executable builds, you can ignore the warnings.

### Open the ExampleApp executable and you should see:

## **(6) Start experimenting with the API**

### Click here to [Get Started!](Get_Started.md)
